# Speech-to-Text using DeepSpeech2

## Overview
This project implements a speech-to-text system using the DeepSpeech2 model. The model is trained on the LJSpeech dataset.

## Dependencies
- TensorFlow
- Jiwer
- (Include other dependencies and versions)

## Dataset
The model is trained on the LJSpeech dataset, which can be found [here](https://data.keithito.com/data/speech/LJSpeech-1.1.tar.bz2).

## Setup and Installation
1. Install the required dependencies.
2. Download the LJSpeech dataset.
3. (Include any additional setup steps)

## Training
- Describe the training process and important parameters.

## Inference
- Explain how to use the trained model for speech-to-text inference.
- Provide code snippets for making predictions.

## Results
- Model performance: Word Error Rate (WER).
- Example predictions and ground truth.
